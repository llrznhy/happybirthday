**Team Guidelines for Jira and Github**

1. **Jira**

Jira is a platform used to assign tasks to team members, which is helpful for the implementation and management of project processes.

• According to the progress of the project, the product owner and scrum master create tasks every week, including management task and development task.

• Team members choose they need and want to do in time.

•Members should drag tasks to different status lists, such as ‘TO DO’, ‘IN PROGRESS’, ‘DONE’, based on individual progress.

• Use the tagging feature to label tasks, e.g. priority

• Team members are expected to update task status in a timely manner to ensure transparency and real-time project progress.

2. **Github**

• Members are required to add description when committing changes to describe what was changed, e.g. files added or deleted.

• Maintain changelogs of what has changed and what we did in each release.
